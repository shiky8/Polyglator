# Polyglator
This project demonstrates the concept of polyglot files through practical examples. It includes a C-based executable that can transform itself into a PNG image after execution, a Python script to create such polyglot EXE/PNG files, and an additional example of a multi-language script that works as Bash, Batch, and Python.
